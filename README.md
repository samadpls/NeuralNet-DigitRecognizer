# NeuralNet-DigitRecognizer
This repo uses a neural network to recognize digits from images. It trains the network using the backpropagation algorithm to minimize the error between predicted and actual labels. The code tests the network accuracy and allows the user to input an image to see the predicted digit. ðŸ§ ðŸ’»
